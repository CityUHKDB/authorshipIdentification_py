A Large-scale stylometric Database will be built in the hope of providing a pioneering database schema to store the stylometric features.
We aim to provide a framework for other developers to build different kinds of applications, which requires the analysis of the writing 
styles of authors, Plagiarism Detection Applications, Spam Mails Identification System â€“ for example, based on the database schema 
solution we provided. After the database model has been finalized, an Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection Application will be developed in 
addition to the database schema for stylometric features, in order to show how the stylometric Database model can be applied to solve 
real-life problems and how to archive document similarity search by running SQL queries on our proposed database model.
